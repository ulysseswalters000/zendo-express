              our web design team can tailor your site to fit your needs and your budget.`,
      para2: `When a business is starting out (or simply ready to take it to the next level)
              great web design can be the ultimate make-it-or-break-it difference. Design matters.
              Good business is built on how you make your clients *feel*.
              Ultimately, your website is a reflection of who you are, what your brand can offer them,
              and how you do business.
              Collectively this determines how your potential customers see you and thus feel about you.

              Websites now act as your storefront, which means they are effectively the first point of
              contact between you and your potential customers.
              A good website should be appealing to the sense, concise, convenient
              and enjoyable to browse, and clearly explain out of the gate what you
              are offering to your potential clients. You have around 10 seconds to
              make a killer impression, so make sure it’s done right the first time.`,

            business world. Social media is an ever-changing landscape of
            digital opportunity (and pitfalls). To navigate it successfully it's
            important to stay ahead of the curve. Your business deserves your
            attention, and as a busy owner you likely have a million tasks that
            don't involve learning the ins and outs of social media over and
            over and over again. Do yourself a favor and let us handle it for
            you. Up to speed on the most current trends, algorithms, and
            policies of the multitudes of possible platforms, our social media
            team will ensure that your business is getting the attention it
            deserves where it matters most.`,
    para2: `Think social media is optional when it comes to marketing your
            business? Think again. As of January 2019, 4.2 billion of the
            world’s 7.7 billion people are active internet users. There are
            3.40 billion unique social media users. On average, people have
            5.54 social media accounts, and spend around 2 hours a day on them.
            Between September 2017 and October 2018, social media users grew by
            320 million, which works out to about one new social media user
            every 10 seconds.`,
    para3: `Did you know that Instagram’s algorithms are changing rapidly, and
            now, your post gradually disappears if you don’t respond in 60
            minutes or less to comments left. Do you have time to continually
            check every social media platform and feed for new comments,
            mentions and messages? Probably not, but we sure do.`,
    para4: `Social media bridges the gap between consumers and brands by
            providing them with a platform to engage with each other.
            Businesses need to make the most of the powerful and massive force
            that is social media, and create opportunities for interaction and

            it’s imperative to ensure your marketing materials are

  seoData: {
    para1: `Search Engine Optimization is the key to the web. When your website
            and social media pages are fully optimized, search engines such as
            Google and Yahoo give your listing a higher priority, placing you
            above your competition. It can be a complicated world of keywords
            and analytics, but our expert web team knows how to crack the code.
            By utilizing SEO properly, we'll help to propel your business into
            the Top 5 of any web search results.`,
    subHeading: `But what is SEO?`,
    para2: `In the most simple terms, Search Engine Optimization is a way to
            improve your website so that it will appear as close as possible to the #1
            position across all online search engine results, scuh as Google, Yahoo,
            Bing and more. When you perform a search on Google, the order by which the
            returning results are displayed is based on complex algorithms.
            These algorithms (also known as search engine ranking algorithms), take a
            large number of factors into account before they decide in which order the
            relevant web pages will be shown. Optimizing your website for search
            engines will give you an advantage over non-optimized sites and you
            increase your chances to rank higher, including being on the first page of
            the results, or even ranking in the number one, two or three slot.`,
    para3: `The majority of search engines users are 95% likely to click on one
            of the top five suggestions in the results pages. In order to take
            advantage of this and gain visitors to your web site or customers
            to your online store, your website needs to appear in one of the
            top positions. However SEO is not only about search engines, but
            rather good SEO practices improve the user experience and usability
            of a web site.`,
    para4: `The bottom line is that strong SEO practices put you ahead of your
            competition. Internet users trust search engines to return them the
            best results, so landing among the top few results is critical to
            having website that runs smoothly and is easy to find.`

            business site - Amazon, eBay, Google, Yelp - and you’ll see that
            the basis of their platform (or at least the thing that separates
            the winners from the losers on them) comes down to one singular
            thing: reviews. Friendly word-of-mouth referral has long since been
            the #1 way for people to recommend goods and  services that they
            love (or not). Internet reviews are no different, it’s just on a
            broader and more anonymous   level. In modern day business, it’s
            essential to gain and keep strong reviews, and while that might
            feel like a lot of pressure, it’s important to not be scared… as
            it’s most basically a free referral system. Did you know that your

            you respond to every review? You work hard to let your reviews tell
            your story… so let us work hard to make them work for you. Great
            reviews are the most valuable tip a business can receive.`,
    para2: `It’s important to stay ahead of the curve and be alert and
            proactive when it comes to your reviews. This is where you get to
            engage your clients, build their trust, express your gratitude, and
            in the unfortunate case of negative reviews, share your side. We
            can help you establish a responsive plan of action for handling
            negative reviews, problematic PR coverage, or any other customer
            service troubles you might encounter. It’s important to stay
            vigilant across ALL of the online platforms to ensure that your
            online reputation stays as bulletproof as possible.`,
    para3: `Rule #1 of establishing a strong online reputation is making
            yourself easy to find and being trustworthy. It is essential that
            all of your information matches across the board, as this helps for
            search engines find you and thus build their trust (i.e. rank
              you higher). You’ll need to establish some backlinks and
              cross-references, and it’s important to check in regularly online
              and keep all of your information up-to-date. Many search engines
              these days are automated, and they are trained to “scrape” other
              well-known sites for information. Often times, this can lead to
              incorrect information about your business being plugged in, which
              can affect your organic ranking and how search engines find you.
              If a search engine can’t find you, your prospective clients most
              definitely can’t!`

            and captures their attention immediately. People spend only
